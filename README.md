# Hello-World
This is another tutorial repository by a git-hub noob.  Move along.  Or stay.  I'm not your dictator.

If you decided to stay (no need to if you have other things to do), welcome.  My name is
Fayyt.  I'm a total noob about coding and git-hub.  If everything goes as planned,
you'll be hearing about my company all over the place in a couple of years!!
